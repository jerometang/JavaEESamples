## springboot-dubbo example
Have a completed sample with below components, this example depends on zookeeper for service registration: 
* example-api: used for exchange contract between dubbo provider & consumer.
* example-provider: dubbo example service provider.
* example-consumer: dubbo example service consumer.

### Dependency
* local zookeeper

### How to play?
* launch local zookeeper service at default port 2181.
* launch "example-provider" as spring-boot application.
* launch "example-consumer" as spring-boot application.
* call consumer api with parameters at http://localhost:8082/hello?greeting=hello, the expected output is "Default Service Provider: hello"

### What is not good?
* Consumer application will not work after provider application restart, consumer application still need to restart if provider application restarted.
